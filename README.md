## Project Description

The Bank Loan Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the performance and characteristics of loan applications. This project utilizes SQL queries to analyze various aspects of loan data, including the total number of loan applications, funded amounts, and payments received.

### Key Features

- **KPI Analysis**: Evaluate key performance indicators such as total loan applications, amounts funded, and amounts received.
- **Monthly and Previous Month Analysis**: Compare loan metrics on a month-to-date (MTD) and previous month-to-date (PMTD) basis.
- **Interest Rate and Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Analyze average interest rates and debt-to-income ratios for a better understanding of loan terms and borrower profiles.
- **Loan Status Breakdown**: Examine the percentage and amount of good versus bad loans to assess overall loan performance and risk.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Review loan data by various demographics such as state, term, employee length, purpose, and home ownership to identify trends and patterns.

### Project Goals

- **Performance Evaluation**: Determine the overall effectiveness of loan issuance and repayment strategies.
- **Trend Identification**: Identify trends in loan applications, funding, and repayments across different time periods and demographics.
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess the quality of loans issued by analyzing the proportion of good and bad loans.

### Data Source

The project utilizes a dataset (`bank_loan_data`) containing detailed information on loan applications, including loan amounts, interest rates, payments, statuses, and borrower demographics.

### Use Cases

- **Financial Analysis**: Ideal for financial analysts and decision-makers seeking to understand loan performance and trends.
- **Risk Management**: Useful for assessing loan risk and optimizing lending strategies.
- **Reporting**: Provides valuable insights for generating reports on loan performance and borrower characteristics.
